# AI Aimbot and Trigger Bot

A real-time, AI-powered aimbot and trigger bot leveraging NVIDIA TensorRT for fast deep learning inference. This tool captures a specific screen region, detects targets using a neural network, and automatically moves the mouse and triggers actions. It includes an overlay and a Tkinter control panel for real-time visual feedback and customizable settings.

If you're familiar with my previous project featuring YOLO-based AimBot, TriggerBot, and Recoil Control, you can check it out here:

- **Official Website:** [GamerFun](https://www.gamerfun.club/ai-aimbot-triggerbot-shooter-games)
- **Forum Discussion:** [UnknownCheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/rainbow-six-siege/671029-gamerfun-ai-menu-mouse-aimbot-triggerbot-recoil-control-using-lgub-drivers.html)
- **GitHub Repository:** [Your GitHub Repo](https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name)

This release focuses exclusively on **AimBot** and **TriggerBot**, with significantly improved speed and accuracy.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Target Detection:** Uses a pre-trained model with TensorRT for high-speed inference.
- **Real-Time Screen Capture:** Captures specific screen regions using `mss`.
- **Customizable Overlay:** Displays scanning areas and detected targets via a transparent Tkinter overlay.
- **Control Panel:** Configure:
  - Aimbot and trigger bot toggle.
  - Aimbot speed adjustments.
  - Target area selection (head, neck, chest, legs, etc.).
  - Custom key bindings.
- **Keyboard & Mouse Handling:** Uses `pynput` to manage key and mouse events.
- **Mouse Driver Integration:** Uses Logitech-CVE mouse driver (`ghub_mouse.dll`) from [ekknod on GitHub](https://github.com/ekknod/logitech-cve) for precise control.
